## Setup

To use `cds compile to openapi` functionality, simply add this self-configuring plugin package to your project:

```sh
 npm add @cap-js/openapi
```

In this guide, we use the [Incidents Management reference sample app](https://github.com/cap-js/incidents-app) as the base, to generate the OpenAPI document for the `services.cds` file.

## Generate OpenAPI document

### 1. Usage of programatic API

await `cds.compile(<file path>).to.openapi()` to invoke `cds compile to openapi` programatically.


### 2. Usage from CLI 

Run `cds compile <file path> -2 openapi` in the CLI to generate the OpenAPI document.
